DONE - use magnitude for colour scaling

- provide some control (or presets) for colour animation

- show magnitude at mouse co-ords

- set pixel w+h based on window size

- add palette-rotating animation option

- fix entry scaling

- interaction between refresh and high number of steps causes
  flickering/blanking. Can we do better?

- use a (fixed) number of goros to parallelise the mandel calc
