Remembering CGA-graphics era mandelbrot generators I wanted to knock together
something similar. A quick google for the easiest way to display a golang
image.Image led me to the fyne UI.

I'm now playing with both a little, to better understand the UI toolkit and
perhaps play with the visualisation a little more.
